 * A Finder/Dock-launched app inherits launchd's bare PATH

 * that breaks two things at once: the integrated terminal starts with a PATH
 * that has no Homebrew, no `~/.local/bin` and often no `git` the user would
 * recognise; and any git subprocess that shells out to a credential helper or a
 * signing binary can't find it.
 *
 * The symptom is maddening because it only happens when launched from Finder —
 * run the same build from a terminal and everything works, because the terminal
 * already exported the right PATH.
 *
 * The fix: ask the user's login shell for its PATH once at boot and fold it
 * into `process.env.PATH` before anything is spawned.
 *
 * Cribbed near-verbatim from ~/Dev/midnite/packages/desktop/src/main/shell-path.ts.
