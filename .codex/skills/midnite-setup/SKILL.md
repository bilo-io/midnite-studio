description: Bootstrap a brand-new project repo from scratch — ask ~10 questions about the stack and product, then scaffold a moon-style repo with a README, a .claude (brainstorm + exec skills, a tailored CLAUDE.md, subagents), and a todo/ folder with one connected MVP phase doc per app.
---

**Invoke with:** [optional: a project name or one-line description, and/or a target directory]

You are running the **setup** workflow: an interactive, human-in-the-loop session that **bootstraps a brand-new project repository** from nothing. You ask the user **~10 questions** — first about the **repo shape + stack**, then (the majority) about the **product's context** — and then scaffold the repo so it's immediately workable with the `brainstorm` and `exec` skills.

This skill is modelled on how **midnite** itself is laid out (moon + proto monorepo, `.claude/` skills + subagents, a `todo/` phase tracker). The output is a *seed*, not a finished product — one MVP phase doc per app, connected where the apps depend on each other, ready for `/exec` to pick up.

## Context you must respect
- **Do not scaffold anything until the user has answered the questions and confirmed the blueprint (Stage 4).** This is a one-human-in-the-loop bootstrap, not an autonomous build.
- The **target** is a *new* repo, not midnite-git. Never write into the midnite-git tree except to *read* the source `brainstorm`/`exec` skills you copy out. Resolve the target dir in Stage 0.
- Keep the question count to **~10** — terse, mostly **a direct question to the user** (it batches up to 4 per call, always offers **"Other"**, and supports `multiSelect` for checkbox-style picks). Always invite the user to extend/replace any option.
- **Tailor everything to the answers.** Don't ask theming/i18n/look-and-feel questions if there's no frontend app; don't ask the API-language question if there's no API. Don't scaffold a mobile phase doc if there's no mobile app.
- The skills you copy (`brainstorm`, `exec`) assume a `todo/` tracker (`_INDEX.md`, `phase-N-*.md`, `done.md`, `README.md`) and a `CLAUDE.md` of conventions — so you **must** generate those too, or the copied skills won't have anything to run against.

## 🎯 Stage 0 — Resolve the target & seed the brief
1. Determine the **target directory** from `$ARGUMENTS` (a path or a project name → kebab-slug dir). If none, **ask** ("Where should I scaffold this — current empty dir, or a new `./<slug>/`?"). If the dir is non-empty, stop and confirm before writing into it.
2. Capture a **freeform brief**: *what the project is about*, its **name**, a one-line pitch, and the target users. `$ARGUMENTS` may seed this; otherwise ask conversationally (this is the one open-ended "question" — the a direct question to the user rounds below are the structured ~10).

## 🧱 Stage 1 — Repo shape & stack (questions 1–3)
Ask via **a direct question to the user** (batch these):
1. **Repo shape** — `Single repo` vs `Monorepo (moon + proto)`. Recommend monorepo if more than one app is implied.
2. **Which apps?** (`multiSelect`, only if monorepo — else infer the one app) — `Website` (marketing) · `Webapp` (product UI) · `Mobile app` · `API / gateway` · `Docs site` · `CLI` · `Desktop app`. Map each to a default stack:
   - Website + Webapp + Docs → **Next.js (App Router)** (docs may instead be a Vite + MDX site if the user prefers — offer it)
   - Mobile → **React Native (Expo)**
   - Desktop → **Tauri** or **Electron** (offer the choice)
   - CLI → **commander (TypeScript)**
3. **API language** (only if API/gateway chosen) — `Nest.js (TypeScript)` *(recommended — matches the TS-everywhere default)* · `Python (FastAPI)` · `.NET` · `Go`.

## 🎨 Stage 2 — Product context (questions 4–10)
The **majority** of the interview. Ask via **a direct question to the user**, batched, and **skip any that don't apply** to the chosen apps. Aim to land the total around 10 questions.
4. **Product type** — `SaaS` · `Marketing/landing` · `Internal tool` · `Mobile-first app` · `API product` · `Content/docs`.
5. **Pricing & tiers** (frontend/SaaS) — `Free + Pro + Enterprise` · `Freemium` · `One-time purchase` · `None / not yet`. If tiered, note a pricing page is in scope.
6. **Legal documents** (`multiSelect`) — `Privacy policy` · `Terms of service` · `Cookie policy` · `Acceptable use` · `None`.
7. **Social links** (`multiSelect`, checkbox-style icons) — `GitHub` · `X / Twitter` · `LinkedIn` · `Discord` · `Instagram` · `YouTube` · `Mastodon` · `None`.
8. **Translations / i18n** (frontend) — `English only` · `Multi-locale` (ask which locales via "Other" or a follow-up).
9. **Theming** (`multiSelect`, frontend) — `Light` · `Dark` · `System-based` · `Time-based (auto day/night)` · `Color presets` · `Custom colors`.
10. **Look & feel** — `Minimalist` · `Animated / lively` · `Playful` · `Corporate / clean` · `Brutalist` · `Glassmorphic`.

Keep the **"suggest your own / add to this"** door open on every round. If the brief makes an answer obvious, state your assumption and fold it in rather than spending a question on it.

## ✅ Stage 3 — (optional) Ground the stack
If any stack choice needs a sanity check (current framework conventions, a library's setup), do a quick check — grep/read inline, or dispatch a focused read-only subagent (e.g. `Explore`). Don't over-research; this is a seed.

## 📋 Stage 4 — Confirm the blueprint — STOP for the human
Play back a tight summary and get a clear go-ahead before writing anything:
- **Project**: name + one-line pitch.
- **Repo**: single vs monorepo; the app list with each app's stack.
- **Context**: product type, pricing, legal docs, socials, i18n, theming, look & feel.
- **What I'll scaffold** (the file list from Stage 5).
- **Subagents** I'll generate.
- **Phase docs** (one per app) + how they connect.

If the user wants changes, loop back. Only proceed once they confirm.

## 🏗️ Stage 5 — Scaffold the repo
Create sub-tasks with a running task list, then write everything. Tailor every file to the answers.

**a. Repo skeleton**
- `git init` the target if it isn't a repo. Add a sensible `.gitignore` (node + the chosen stacks).
- **Monorepo**: scaffold moon + proto like midnite — `.prototools` (pin node + pnpm), `.moon/{workspace,toolchain,tasks}.yml`, root `package.json` (pnpm workspace), `packages/<app>/` per chosen app with a minimal `moon.yml` declaring `dependsOn` for the cross-app edges (e.g. webapp/website depend on `shared`; nothing imports another app's internals). Include a `packages/shared/` for cross-app contracts (zod schemas/types) when there's an API + a client.
- **Single repo**: a flat layout for the one app's stack.

**b. README.md** — at the repo root. Cover: what the project is, the stack, the repo layout, common commands (moon/pnpm if monorepo), and a **"Working with Claude Code"** section that **documents the `brainstorm` and `exec` skills** (what each does, when to use it, the `todo/` flow they drive) and the generated subagents.

**c. `.claude/`**
- **Copy the `brainstorm` and `exec` skills verbatim** into `<target>/.claude/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` and `<target>/.claude/skills/exec/SKILL.md`. Source them from this `setup` skill's siblings — for this install, `/Users/bilolwabona/Dev/midnite-git/.claude/skills/{midnite-brainstorm,midnite-exec}/SKILL.md` — but **strip the `midnite-` prefix on the way out**: the target repo isn't Midnite Git, so its copies keep the plain `name: brainstorm` / `name: exec` frontmatter, not the source's `midnite-` names. After copying, lightly adapt any **hard-coded midnite paths** (e.g. the primary-checkout path, package names in examples) to the new repo, but keep the workflow intact.
- **Generate `<target>/.claude/agents/<name>.md`** subagents — each with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`) and a focused system prompt:
  - **Generic, always**: `architect` (designs to the conventions, guards boundaries), `tester` (writes/extends tests at the right layer), `security` (reviews for the common classes of vuln in this stack).
  - **Stack-based**, per chosen app: e.g. `frontend` (Next.js/React + the chosen theming + i18n), `mobile` (Expo), `api` (Nest.js/FastAPI/.NET/Go), `docs-writer` (MDX), `cli-engineer` (commander). Only generate the ones the app list calls for.

**d. `CLAUDE.md`** — a tailored conventions doc for the new repo, in midnite's spirit but for *this* stack: project overview, repo layout, **package boundaries** (the one-way dependency graph for the chosen apps), code style, the git/PR + worktree workflow, testing layers, and the "shared is the contract" rule (if there's a shared package). Don't copy midnite's verbatim — write it for the apps that exist.

**e. `todo/` tracker** — so the copied skills have something to drive:
- `todo/README.md` (the conventions the skills expect: markers, where `done.md` lives, phase-file naming).
- `todo/_INDEX.md` (the roll-up `exec` scans first — one row per phase, Status/Done/Progress, a Theme key).
- `todo/done.md` (empty append-only log, newest-first).
- **One phase doc per app**: `todo/phase-1-<appA>.md`, `phase-2-<appB>.md`, … each in the **house style** the `brainstorm` skill describes: `# Phase N — <App> MVP`, framing blockquotes (what it builds on + scope guardrails + an S/M/L legend), **Themes** with `- [ ]` checklist items + S/M/L tags, a **Files this phase touches** map, a **Verification** checklist, and a **Decisions / open questions** section. Fold the Stage 2 context into the right app (pricing/legal/socials/i18n/theming/look-and-feel land in the website/webapp docs; API contracts in the API doc).
- **Connect the docs for an MVP**: explicitly cross-link where apps depend on each other — e.g. the **website** links to the **webapp** (sign-up/app CTA) and the **docs**; the **webapp** consumes the **API** via the `shared` contract; **mobile** shares the same `shared` API client; **docs** documents both. Note these as dependencies in each doc's blockquote and in `_INDEX.md`.

## 🎁 Stage 6 — Wrap up
1. **Commit the scaffold** in the new repo (`git add` explicit paths, not `-A`; a `chore: scaffold <project>` commit). Don't push (no remote yet) unless the user set one up — just report it.
2. Print a tight recap: the target path, the tree (key files), the app→phase-doc map with the connections, and the subagents created.
3. Tell the user the next move: **`cd` into the repo, run `pnpm install` (if monorepo), then `/exec`** to pick up the first MVP slice — or `/brainstorm` to add a new phase.

---

Be genuinely collaborative through Stages 0–4 — the interview is the point; the scaffold is mechanical. Don't write a single file until the user has confirmed the blueprint (Stage 4), and tailor every generated file to their answers — never emit midnite-specific content that doesn't apply to their project.
