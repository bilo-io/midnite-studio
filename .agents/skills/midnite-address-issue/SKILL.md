name: midnite-address-issue
description: Triage the Midnite Git issue board, recommend the highest-impact issue (plus 3 alternatives), agree a fix plan interactively, then build it in a worktree and open a linked PR. Stops at the PR — never merges.
---

**Invoke with:** [optional: issue number, label, or keyword]

End-to-end "fix a reported issue" for **Midnite Git**, driven by the repo's issue board.

**Conversation style — enforced.** Be terse to save time and tokens. No preamble, no recap of these instructions, no narrating what you're *about* to do. Report results, not intentions; bullets over prose. Stay silent on no-op stages. Spend tokens on the root cause, the diff, and the decisions — not commentary.

## The board — read this first

- **Issues and code live in the same repo**, so `Fixes #N` in a PR body **auto-closes** the issue on merge, bare `gh` commands hit the right repo, and cross-references show up on the issue. (This differs from midnite's two-repo split — don't import those habits.)
- Still comment the claim on the issue (Stage 4) and a human-readable wrap-up after merge (Stage 12) — auto-close tells the reporter *that* it closed, not *what* changed for them.
- If `gh` says *"Could not resolve repository"*, the active account flipped: `gh auth switch --user bilo-io`.

## Respect

- `CLAUDE.md` = conventions (package boundaries — `shared ◀ git-engine ◀ desktop`, `shared ◀ app`; commit style; pre-push gate). `docs/INITIAL_PLAN.md` is the design source of truth. Re-read the relevant bits before coding.
- Parallel work → git worktrees in the repo-root **`.worktrees/<branch>/`** dir (git-ignored; **never** under `.git/` — that path gets pruned by parallel `git worktree` runs and Vite denies `.git/**`). Keep the primary checkout (`/Users/bilolwabona/Dev/midnite-git`) as home base; all multi-file work happens in the worktree.
- **Every writing tool call must be rooted at the worktree path** — absolute paths rooted at the primary checkout silently edit the wrong tree, and the local gate then passes on stale code.
- `todo/` is the *roadmap* tracker and is **not** the driver here — the issue board is. Only touch `todo/` if the fix happens to close out an existing phase item, and say so if it does.

## 1 · Scan the board

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 50 \
  --json number,title,labels,createdAt,updatedAt,comments,author,url
```

Then read the **body** of every plausible candidate (`gh issue view <n> --comments`) — the reporter's environment details (app version, OS, repo size/shape) are the reproduction recipe.

Filter out, silently:

- `wontfix` · `duplicate` · `invalid` · `question` with no defect behind it.
- **Already claimed / in flight.** Check both sides: a claim comment on the issue, *and* an open PR that names it — `gh pr list --state open --search "#<n>"` plus a plain `gh pr list --state open` skim. A claim comment is **not a lock**: re-check recently merged PRs (`gh pr list --state merged --limit 15`) before starting, since a parallel session may have already shipped it.
- Anything already fixed on `main` but not yet released — verify against the code before believing a stale report. Say so and move on if that's the case.

Emit a tight digest: one line per surviving candidate (`#N · title · labels · age · reporter signal`).

## 2 · Score for impact

Rank candidates on, in order of weight:

1. **Correctness/trust** — does it show users *wrong git state* or corrupt/lose their work? (A graph drawing the wrong topology, a stage/discard hitting the wrong file, is worse than a visual nit.)
2. **Blast radius** — how many users / how central is the surface? A crash or the graph/status panel beats a corner case.
3. **Frequency** — every session vs. rarely.
4. **Fix confidence × cost** — a well-understood one-file fix with a clear test beats a speculative refactor of equal notional value. Prefer landing real value today.
5. **Reporter cost** — a report left silent for weeks is a trust cost of its own.

Deprioritise: cosmetic-only nits, anything needing a product decision you can't make, anything whose root cause you can't locate in this pass.

Assign each a t-shirt size:

| Size | Time |
|------|------|
| `[XS]` | < 30 min |
| `[S]` | 30 min – 2 h |
| `[M]` | 2 – 4 h |
| `[L]` | 4 – 8 h |
| `[XL]` | 1 – 2 d |

## 3 · Choose — STOP for the human

Present via **a direct question to the user**: **exactly 4 options** — your highest-impact recommendation **first**, then 3 genuine alternatives (vary the shape: a quick win, a different surface, a bigger swing — not three near-clones of the top pick).

- **Label:** `#<N> <short title> [<size> · <time>]`
- **Description:** the impact case in one line + why this size.

Mark the recommendation `(Recommended)` and say in one line *why it beats the others*. Bias toward `$ARGUMENTS` if given (an issue number there means: still show the sheet, but that issue is the recommendation unless it's genuinely unfixable — say so if it is). **Do not touch code until they pick.**

## 4 · Claim it — before the worktree

1. Rename the session so it's visible in Claude Desktop:

   ```bash
   printf '\033]0;Loop: exec-issue #%s - %s\007' "<N>" "<short-slug>"
   ```

2. Claim on the issue (this is also the reporter's first sign of life — write it for them, not for us):

   ```bash
   gh issue comment <N> --body "Picking this up now — will report back with the fix. Thanks for the detailed report."
   gh issue edit <N> --add-label "size/<S>"   # create the label first if absent
   ```

   Add the label only if it exists or you create it (`gh label create size/M --color 5D9801`); never let a missing label abort the run.
3. Don't self-assign unless the user asks — assignment reads as a commitment.

## 5 · Reproduce & find the root cause — before any plan

This is the stage that makes or breaks the fix. **Do not plan a fix you can't explain.**

- Replay the reporter's environment: which panel/surface (graph, sidebar, status, terminal), packaged app vs `desktop:start`, and the shape of the repo that triggers it (huge history? worktrees? in-progress merge?). Build a minimal scratch repo that reproduces it where possible.
- Locate the real code (Grep/Glob, or delegate a search to a dedicated read-only sub-task, if your CLI supports spawning one, when the surface is unclear — but you own the conclusion).
- For a wrong-data bug, find where the value is *produced*, not where it's rendered — usually a `git-engine` parser or the lane layout, not the React row. Check the raw git output the parser saw before blaming the UI.
- **Report the root cause in this thread in 2–4 bullets, with `file:line` refs, before Stage 6.** If you genuinely can't find it, stop and say so, with what you ruled out — a wrong fix on a public issue is worse than an honest "needs more digging".

## 6 · Plan — STOP for the human

Present the consequential choices as separate **a direct question to the user** calls. **Minimum 3; use 5+ for anything `[M]` or larger, or when the fix touches a contract in `shared`.** Always include:

- **Fix approach** — the competing ways to correct the root cause (the cheap patch vs. the correct-at-the-source fix). Never hide the honest tradeoff.
- **Scope boundary** — fix only the reported symptom, or the whole class of it (sibling parsers/panels with the same bug)? Say which siblings you found.
- **Test proof** — what test pins it, at which layer.

Then, as the task warrants: IPC contract change in `shared`, git-version sensitivity (dugite vs system git output), destructive-op safety (confirm gating), fallback/error UX.

Tag every option with a **dominant nature** and its size:
`[recommended]` · `[correctness]` · `[simplicity]` · `[minimal]` · `[performance]` · `[DX]` · `[future-proof]` · `[scope+]`

Track the agreed plan with a running task list. **Do not implement until every question is answered.**

## 7 · Worktree

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add .worktrees/issue-<N>-<slug> -b fix/issue-<N>-<slug> origin/main
cd .worktrees/issue-<N>-<slug> && pnpm install
```

Branch prefix: `fix/` for a bug, `feature/` for an enhancement.

## 8 · Build — the failing test comes first

- **Write the regression test before the fix and watch it fail.** That failure is the proof you found the real cause; a test written after a fix proves nothing. Report both states (red → green) in the thread.
- Layer it right: parser/layout/engine logic → Vitest in `git-engine` (fixture strings or temp repos) · `app` component → RTL · visual/flow change → extend the Playwright suite under `packages/app/e2e/`.
- Fix at the source per the agreed plan. Follow `CLAUDE.md` (shared = the IPC contract; zod-validate IPC payloads; `git-engine` stays electron-free; `app` never imports git-engine/electron).
- Small conventional commits, each ending with the required `Co-Authored-By` trailer. Reference the issue in the body as `#<N>`.

## 9 · Verify

- **Visual change → before/after Playwright screenshots** against the Vite renderer (`moon run app:dev`, mocked bridge) or the real app via `moon run desktop:start`; `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` if the browser is missing. Read the PNGs so they render inline in this thread; the same shots go in the PR body.
- **Packaged-app-only bug → verify in a packaged build** (`desktop:install-local`), not just dev, or say plainly that you couldn't and what remains unverified.
- Pre-push gate, in the worktree, all green — never push red:

  ```bash
  moon run :typecheck && moon run :lint && moon run :test
  ```

  Redirect output to a file and check moon's own exit code; piping to `tail` masks failures. If a spec fails only under the full suite, re-run the file alone and confirm against `main` before calling it a regression.

## 10 · Open the PR + link it back

- Push, then `gh pr create --draft --base main`.
- **Title:** `fix(<pkg>): <what> [<size> · <time>]`
- **Body:**
  - **Issue:** `Fixes #<N>` on its own line — same repo, so it **will** auto-close on merge.
  - **Root cause** in 1–3 bullets with `file:line` refs — the *why*, not a list of touched files.
  - **The proof:** the regression test and what it asserts.
  - Embedded before/after screenshots for a visual change. Commit the PNGs on the branch under `docs/screenshots/issue-<N>/` and reference them with **commit-pinned** raw URLs (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/raw/<sha>/docs/screenshots/...`) so they survive a squash-merge + branch delete.
  - The `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` trailer.
- **Self-review your own diff** before marking it ready: fidelity to the agreed plan → `CLAUDE.md` conventions → correctness & coverage → anything the fix could regress elsewhere. Fix what's material, re-run Stage 9, push.
- **Drive CI green:** `gh pr checks <n> --watch`. On failure `gh run view <id> --log-failed` → fix in the worktree → re-run the local gate → push. If genuinely stuck (flaky infra, outage, product call), stop and say exactly what's wrong.
- `gh pr ready <n>` once green.

## 11 · Report — then STOP

Post, terse:

- **PR link** (title + URL) and the **issue link**.
- 3–5 bullets: root cause → fix → test.
- The diff in a ` ```diff ` fenced block (`gh pr diff <n> --patch`, trimmed to the meaningful hunks).
- Screenshots again if visual; anything left unverified, stated plainly.
- One line: what's still open on the issue (e.g. "ships to users in the next release").

**This skill does not merge.** Stop here and let the human review. Do not run `gh pr merge`, and do not tear down the worktree — the branch is still live.

**Before you stop, arm a merge watcher.** Worktrees are big; sweep after merges. Start a background wait that fires when the PR reaches a terminal state:

```bash
until s=$(gh pr view <n> --json state --jq .state 2>/dev/null); \
      [ "$s" = "MERGED" ] || [ "$s" = "CLOSED" ]; do sleep 120; done; echo "PR #<n>: $s"
```

Launch it with `run_in_background: true`. When it fires:

- **MERGED** → do Stage 12's *post-merge* half (issue wrap-up comment, CHANGELOG if user-facing, teardown). You do **not** need to ask again: the human merging *is* the go-ahead for the follow-through. Only the `gh pr merge` call itself needs their say-so.
- **CLOSED** without merging → the work was rejected. Say so, leave the worktree, and don't comment on the issue.

If the session ends before it fires, nothing is lost — Stage 13's sweep catches it next run.

## 12 · Only if the user says merge

- `gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch` (always squash). `Fixes #<N>` auto-closes the issue.
- **Still leave a human-readable wrap-up comment** on the issue — auto-close doesn't tell the reporter what changed:

  ```bash
  gh issue comment <N> --body "Fixed in <PR title> — merged to \`main\`. <one line on what changed for the user.> Ships in the next release."
  ```

  Keep it written for the reporter: what was wrong, what they'll see now, when. No internal jargon.
- Consider a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under the unreleased section if the fix is user-facing.
- Teardown, and report the reclaimed space:

  ```bash
  freed=$(du -sk .worktrees/issue-<N>-<slug> 2>/dev/null | cut -f1)
  git worktree remove .worktrees/issue-<N>-<slug>
  git branch -D fix/issue-<N>-<slug>                  # -D: a squash leaves it "unmerged"
  git worktree prune && git worktree list
  echo "freed ~$(( freed / 1024 )) MB"
  ```

  **Never pass `--force`.** `git worktree remove` refuses when the tree has modified or untracked files, and that refusal is a safety feature. Parallel agent sessions may be live in a "stale" worktree — if a removal balks, leave that worktree alone, name it, and say why.
- Wrap-up: `# 🎉 Fixed: <issue title>` (both links) · what landed · `🧹 Reclaimed ~<N> MB` · `## ⏭️ Next up` (the runner-up from Stage 3).

## 13 · Sweep landed worktrees

Run this at the **start** of every `/midnite-address-issue`, before Stage 1 — it's cheap, and it reclaims disk from runs whose merge landed after their session ended.

A worktree is safe to remove only when **all three** hold:

1. its PR is `MERGED` (a squash-merge means the branch is *not* an ancestor of `main`, so PR state is the oracle — never `git branch --merged`);
2. `git rev-list --count origin/main..<branch>` is `0`;
3. `git status --porcelain` in that worktree is **empty right now** — re-check at the moment of removal, not from a survey taken minutes earlier.

```bash
git fetch origin -q
git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree /{w=$2} /^branch /{print w"\t"$2}' \
  | grep '\.worktrees/' | while IFS=$'\t' read -r dir ref; do
      b=${ref#refs/heads/}
      ahead=$(git rev-list --count "origin/main..$b" 2>/dev/null)
      dirty=$(git -C "$dir" status --porcelain 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
      state=$(gh pr list --state all --head "$b" --json state --jq '.[0].state' 2>/dev/null)
      printf '%-46s ahead=%-4s dirty=%-4s pr=%s\n' "$b" "$ahead" "$dirty" "${state:-none}"
    done
```

Report the table, then remove only the rows that qualify, per-worktree, with the Stage 12 commands. Two rows to leave and call out explicitly rather than tidy away:

- **dirty > 0** — unlanded work, possibly a live parallel session. Leave it.
- **`pr=none` with `ahead=0` and clean** — an empty worktree that never produced a commit. Removing it is safe, but say that's what it was.

Sum the freed space and report one `🧹 Reclaimed ~<N> GB` line.

---

Autonomous through Stages 7–11 once the human has chosen (Stage 3) and answered the plan questions (Stage 6). Stop for: an unlocatable root cause (Stage 5), an unresolved design question, a destructive/irreversible step, CI you can't fix — and always at Stage 11.

Stage 13's sweep is autonomous (it only removes worktrees that pass all three checks). Stage 12 is autonomous **after** the human merges — the merge is the go-ahead; only `gh pr merge` itself needs asking.
