## 2026-08-25 — Phase 0 · Scaffold

proto/moon/pnpm workspace skeleton with four packages (`shared`, `git-engine`, `app`,
`desktop`), eslint 9 flat config carrying the dependency-boundary rules as per-package
`no-restricted-imports` groups, and `@bilo-io/ui@0.1.0` + `@bilo-io/shell@0.1.0` installed from
GitHub Packages (registry auth proven). `moon run :typecheck :lint :test :build` green; single
`react@19.2.8` in the store. Boundary rules negative-tested (probe files importing `electron`
from `app/src` and `git-engine/src` both fail lint).

## 2026-08-25 — Phase 1 · Shared contracts + git-engine exec/parsers

`shared` now carries the whole wire contract (domain zod schemas, `mgit:*` channel constants, IPC
payload schemas, the `MidniteGitBridge` type, the CommandId registry + default keymap), and
`git-engine` reads a real repository: dugite exec with env hygiene, the per-repo write queue, four
NUL-delimited parsers, and `log`/`status`/`refs`/`worktrees` commands including an incremental
`streamLog`. 93 tests green — 47 parser unit tests against fixture strings plus 21 integration
tests that build throwaway repos with real git (renames, conflicts, detached HEAD, unborn repo,
linked worktrees, upstream ahead/behind). `scripts/smoke.ts` parses ~/Dev/midnite — 4 worktrees,
200 refs, 2000 commits in 156ms.

## 2026-08-25 — Phase 2 · Lane layout engine

`LaneLayoutSession.push(commits) → GraphRow[]`: a single forward pass over `--topo-order` output
assigning straight branch lanes with left-first lane recycling, and sha-derived colours so a
branch keeps its colour across refreshes. Streaming-safe — batched layout is byte-identical to a
one-shot pass. 28 unit tests (linear, single merge, octopus, criss-cross, orphan roots, multiple
children, truncated history, degenerate input) plus structural invariants and an inline snapshot.
`smoke.ts` renders the lanes as ASCII next to `git log --graph` and they match row for row on
~/Dev/midnite.
